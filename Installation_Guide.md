There are two ways:
- by command line
- by eclipse ide

I will describe with the second one as thats the way we are working and in the future i will add the command line option.

1. Import the project into eclipse
2. Import external jars (Project properties) located on the JGraphT diectory (all jars you can find)

3. Change Java version used in the project of eclipse to 6.0

4. Compile & Run the 'Agente.java'
